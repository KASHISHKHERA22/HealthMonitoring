                    <p>
                        The pulse rate, measured in beats per minute (BPM), indicates the heart's rhythmic contraction
                        and
                        relaxation. For adults, the average resting pulse rate ranges from 60 to 100 BPM. Factors such
                        as age,
                        fitness level, and emotional state can influence pulse rate. Regular monitoring helps assess
                        cardiovascular health.

                    <p>
                        The human body temperature, typically around 36.5 to 37.5 degrees Celsius (97.7 to 99.5 degrees
                        Fahrenheit), is regulated by the hypothalamus. Variations can signal health conditions. Fever,
                        often indicating infection, raises body temperature, while hypothermia, from exposure or
                        illness, lowers it. Temperature stability is crucial for bodily functions.
